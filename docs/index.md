## BioThermR: an R package for standardized processing, visualization, and statistical analysis of thermal imaging data in animal studies

`BioThermR` is an R package designed to provide an end-to-end analysis
pipeline for infrared thermography (IRT) data in animal experimentation.
It addresses the lack of standardized, reproducible, and
batch-processing workflows in current thermal imaging analysis.

# BioThermR: Standardized Processing and Analysis of Thermal Imaging Data in Animal Studies

A comprehensive framework for the standardized analysis of thermal
imaging data in animal experimentation. It integrates data import (FLIR,
raw, CSV), automated and interactive Region of Interest (ROI)
segmentation, and high-throughput batch processing.
